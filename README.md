# Movie-Recommnder-System-in-Python
In this project, I have created a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item, in this case, movies. Keep in mind, this is not a true robust recommendation system, to describe it more accurately,it just tells you what movies/items are most similar to your movie choice.
We are using correlation logic to recommend a movie based on previous data.
